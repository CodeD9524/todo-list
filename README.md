What react is is pretty much a combination of HTML and JavaScript so JavaScript is JS dot JS to be specific and react is .JSX So I installed the latest node latest meaning LTS not current that was my mistake and I entered in the information needed to get the react to work and what react is doing is is putting in the HTML inside of a function and react is at the bottom of return so it returning the informati so in essence wrecked is kind of a sort of way of inputting information. I still need to put in the information in the function react is pretty much like a shortcut so you can put for example a code one single code and react and that single code will get the information from the function which is HTML and put it in your react if that makes sense
